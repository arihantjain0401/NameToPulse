# NameToPulse
A mini project intended to learn integrating Matlab with Python and finally connect to the website. Python is used to call a session from Matlab which then takes your name as input and converts it into Morse code, then to binary and plot a heartbeat pulse of your name.

Step1: write your code in matlab. It should be of function type and not script (here, u.m)
Step2: write matlab.engine.shareEngine in MATLAB command line
Step3: run python.py. It has the code which connects to matlab engine and the session shared
Step4: Enter your name
Step5: save graph
